# Page Confetti

A simple jquery library that adds confetti to your web page and reacts to mouse movement. (Based on HTML5 canvas)

## Usage

Include the `canvas-confetti.js` script and invoke the `pageConfetti` function.

## Requirements

The script is dependent on jquery (which must be loaded prior to this) and works only on browsers that support the canvas element.
